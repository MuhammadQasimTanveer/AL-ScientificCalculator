# 🧮 Scientific Calculator (Assembly x86)

A command-line based scientific calculator developed in x86 Assembly Language. It supports both basic and advanced arithmetic operations using BIOS interrupts and macros, compiled with MASM or TASM. The calculator interacts with the user through keyboard input and text output on the console.

## ✨ Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
- Power operations: square and cube of a number  
- Square root calculation (approximate integer root)  
- Decimal to binary conversion (0–9 only)  
- Input validation for division by zero  
- Loop-back mechanism for continuous operations  
- User-friendly interface using text prompts and macros  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- x86 Assembly (MASM or TASM)  
- BIOS interrupt (INT 21h)  
- DOSBox for execution in modern environments
