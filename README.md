ðŸ§® Scientific Calculator (Assembly x86)

 A command-line based scientific calculator developed in x86 Assembly Language. It supports both basic 
 and advanced arithmetic operations using BIOS interrupts and macros, compiled with MASM or TASM. The 
 calculator interacts with the user through keyboard input and text output on the console.

âœ¨ Features

 â€¢ Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
 â€¢ Power operations: square and cube of a number
 â€¢ Square root calculation (approximate integer root)
 â€¢ Decimal to binary conversion (0â€“9 only)
 â€¢ Input validation for division by zero
 â€¢ Loop-back mechanism for continuous operations
 â€¢ User-friendly interface using text prompts and macros
